# HueTracer: Cell-cell interaction prediction model for Visium HD spatial transcriptome platform
HueTracer is a software program created as a follow-up to [DeepCOLOR](https://github.com/kojikoji/deepcolor) software.

## Instalation
You can install HueTracer using pip command from your shell.
```shell
pip install huetracer
```

## Usage
You need to prepare Visium HD spatial transcriptome data generated with SpaceRanger program by 10X. You can see the usage in [nucleus segmentation tutorial](tutorial/nucleus_segmentation_tutorial.ipynb).
